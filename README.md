# MultiplyScattering_learn_moments


A Julia library for learning the radius and concentration of a material by using the moments of simulated backscattered waves.

 
 

This method is particularly efficient at solving acoustic problems with lots of
circular scatterers set in an infinite domain.

## Get started
This package is tested and works for Julia 0.6 and 0.5.

First you will need to get the training data....
[MultiplyScattering](https://github.com/jondea/MultipleScattering.jl).


To get started, download and include the library
```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/jondea/MultipleScattering.jl.git")
using MultipleScattering
```

## Simple example
