# MultipleScatteringLearnMoments


A Julia library for learning the radius and concentration of a material by using the moments of simulated backscattered waves. The backscattered waves are generated by the [MultipleScattering](https://github.com/jondea/MultipleScattering.jl) julia package
 
## Dependencies

using StatsBase
using JLD
using GLMNet
using Plots 
using LaTeXStrings
using MultipleScattering

## Get started
This package is tested and works for Julia 0.6 and 0.5.

First you will need to get the training data....
[MultipleScattering](https://github.com/jondea/MultipleScattering.jl).


To get started, download and include the library
```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/gowerrobert/MultipleScatteringLearnMoments")

```
using MultipleScattering
using MultipleScatteringLearnMoments

## Simple example
see

demo_L2.ipynb


## More examples

To generate the regularization parameter lambda and the kernel parameters using crossvalidation, run
